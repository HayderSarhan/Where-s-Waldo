# Browser Fingerprinting & User Identification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on browser fingerprinting & neural networks.

## Project (Where's Waldo?)

A binary classification project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify a specific user ("Waldo") based on browser fingerprinting data.

**Key Features:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of browser fingerprinting data
- Feature engineering from browsing sessions, locations, and temporal data
- Fully connected feed-forward ANN implementation
- Feature importance analysis using permutation testing
- Model evaluation on hidden test dataset

**Dataset Includes:**
- Browser and OS information
- Geographic location data
- Website visit patterns and duration
- Temporal features (date/time)
- User session characteristics
